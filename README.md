Explanation:- This simple 2-player dice game has been created using HTML, CSS, and js.
In this game, two users compete to get a total score of 50 before the other one
in order to win the game.
A user can either keep rolling the dice or hold his turn and give it to the other player.
If a user keeps on rolling the dice then the score of that turn for the user will keep adding up but
the only catch is if he gets a 1, then all the score of that turn for that user will be undone
and the other user will get the dice by default.

Getting a 1 will not affect the total score of the users though.

If a user rolls a dice and gets a good amount of score for that turn and he feels that he should 
save this score before he gets a 1 and his efforts are undone, then he can hold his turn by clicking the hold button
which will add the score of that turn to the total score for that user and control will go to another user.

First one to get to 50 wins. You can always reset the game by clicking the reset button and can enjoy it as many times as you want.
